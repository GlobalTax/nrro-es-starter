      "eyebrow": "Frequently asked questions",
      "title": "Questions about the Beckham Law",
      "subtitle": "Answers to the most common questions about the expat regime",
      "q1": "What exactly is the Beckham Law?",
      "a1": "It's a special tax regime that allows professionals who transfer their residence to Spain to be taxed as non-residents for a maximum of 6 years, applying a fixed rate of 24% on employment income obtained in Spain, instead of the general progressive income tax scale that can reach up to 47%.",
      "q2": "How long can I benefit from the Beckham Law?",
      "a2": "You can apply for this regime during the tax period in which you acquire tax residence in Spain and the following 5 tax periods, which represents a maximum of 6 complete calendar years.",
      "q3": "What types of income are taxed at 24%?",
      "a3": "The 24% rate applies to employment and business income obtained in Spain up to €600,000. Above this amount, the rate is 47%. Capital income and capital gains are taxed at 19-26% according to non-resident regulations.",
      "q4": "Do I have to pay taxes on my foreign income?",
      "a4": "No. One of the main advantages of the Beckham Law is that you'll only pay taxes on Spanish-sourced income. Income obtained abroad (dividends, interest, rent, etc.) is exempt from taxation in Spain, although you must declare it as exempt income.",
      "q5": "When should I submit the application?",
      "a5": "You must submit the application (form 149) within 6 months from the start of your work activity in Spain. It's essential to meet this deadline because otherwise you'll lose the possibility of applying for the regime.",
      "q6": "Can I apply if I've already been in Spain for some time?",
      "a6": "No. One of the requirements is not having been a tax resident in Spain during the previous 10 years. If you're already a resident, you cannot apply for this regime. It's important to plan the transfer in advance.",
      "q7": "What if I work for a foreign company?",
      "a7": "You can apply for the regime as long as the work is effectively performed in Spanish territory and for companies or entities resident in Spain. If you work remotely for a foreign company, the situation is more complex and must be analyzed case by case.",
      "q8": "Can I be a company director and apply for the regime?",
      "a8": "Yes, the regime allows those appointed as directors of entities in Spain to apply, as long as they meet the other requirements. It's a widely used option by international executives and entrepreneurs.",
